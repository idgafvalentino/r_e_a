Rather than prescribing a single \"correct\" resolution, this analysis presents different frameworks and offers guidance for contextual ethical decision-making.\n\n## Utilitarianism Perspective\n\n**Core Values:** unspecified\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n- From a consequentialist perspective, installing advanced filtration systems maximizes overall wellbeing by protecting health while preserving jobs.\n\n**Reflective Questions from this Perspective:**\n1. What outcomes would maximize overall welfare for all parties involved?\n2. How do we accurately measure and compare the welfare impacts on different stakeholders?\n3. How does the specific context of \"Environmental Justice Dilemma\" affect how Utilitarianism principles should be applied?\n\n## Rights-Based Ethics Perspective\n\n**Core Values:** unspecified\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n- From a rights-based perspective, residents have a fundamental right to clean air and a healthy environment that overrides economic considerations.\n\n**Reflective Questions from this Perspective:**\n1. How would a Rights-Based Ethics approach prioritize the values at stake in this dilemma?\n2. From a Rights-Based Ethics perspective, what considerations should have the most weight?\n3. How does the specific context of \"Environmental Justice Dilemma\" affect how Rights-Based Ethics principles should be applied?\n\n## Contextual Factors for Ethical Decision-Making\n\n- **Dilemma Context**: A community is facing potential health risks from a nearby industrial facility.\n- **Specific Setting**: The facility provides jobs but releases pollutants that may affect local health.\n- **Health Impact**: 0.8 (Severity of health impacts)\n- **Economic Value**: 0.7 (Economic importance of the facility)\n\n## Decision-Making Framework\n\nRather than enforcing a single resolution, a pluralistic approach suggests the following decision-making process:\n\n1. **Identify Values at Stake:** This dilemma involves tension between unspecified (emphasized by Utilitarianism) and unspecified (emphasized by Rights-Based Ethics).\n\n2. **Consider Multiple Perspectives:**\n   - From Utilitarianism: From a consequentialist perspective, installing advanced filtration systems maximizes overall wellbeing by protecting health while preserving jobs.\n   - From Rights-Based Ethics: From a rights-based perspective, residents have a fundamental right to clean air and a healthy environment that overrides economic considerations.\n\n3. **Weigh Contextual Factors:** The specific context of this dilemma (The facility provides jobs but releases pollutants that may affect local health.) must inform how these ethical perspectives are applied.\n\n4. **Make a Situated Ethical Decision:** A decision should be made based on careful consideration of both frameworks, with special attention to which values are most critical in this specific context.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRegarding install filters, both Utilitarianism and Rights-Based Ethics offer valid ethical considerations. The ethical decision should be made while:\n\n1. Acknowledging the legitimacy of both perspectives\n2. Considering the specific contextual factors in this case\n3. Recognizing that reasonable people may disagree on the ethical course of action\n4. Taking responsibility for the ethical decision while showing respect for both ethical frameworks\n\nThis pluralistic approach does not eliminate ethical conflict but rather provides a framework for navigating it with awareness of multiple valid ethical perspectives.",
