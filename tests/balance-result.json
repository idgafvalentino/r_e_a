The technology has high accuracy but raises concerns about privacy, potential discrimination, and surveillance creep.), a balanced approach would:\n1. Acknowledge both the welfare concerns raised by Rights-Balanced Utilitarianism and the community concerns raised by Community-Centered Virtue Approach\n2. Recognize that the situational factors particularly emphasize welfare in this specific case\n3. Propose a course of action that maintains core protections for welfare while adequately addressing community\n\nTherefore, regarding full_implementation, a balanced approach would proceed with the action, but ensure that both welfare (emphasized by Rights-Balanced Utilitarianism) and community (emphasized by Community-Centered Virtue Approach) are respected through careful implementation.\n",
