This approach has particular strengths in addressing outcome optimization and overall well-being.\n\nThe undefined perspective offers equally valid insights by focusing on community. This approach is particularly strong in addressing social cohesion and communal well-being.\n\n## Key Tensions\n- Tension between welfare and virtue\n- Tension between utility and virtue\n- Tension between rights and community\n- Tension between rights and virtue\n- Different ethical perspectives lead to different normative conclusions\n\n## Multi-Perspective Decision Framework\nA multi-perspective approach to this dilemma includes:\n\n1. **undefined Considerations**\n   - Primary Focus: welfare, utility\n   - Key Question: What action will produce the greatest overall welfare for all affected parties?\n\n2. **undefined Considerations**\n   - Primary Focus: community, solidarity\n   - Key Question: What best serves the common good and community values?\n\n3. **Decision Process**\n   - Analyze the dilemma through both frameworks separately\n   - Identify points of agreement and tension\n   - Consider contextual factors that might give one framework priority in this specific case\n   - Make a provisional judgment while remaining open to revision\n\n4. **Acceptance Criteria**\n   An acceptable resolution should acknowledge the legitimacy of both perspectives and explain why one might take precedence in this specific context, or why both should be held in productive tension.\n\n## Recommendations for Further Deliberation\n1. Include advocates of both undefined and undefined perspectives in the deliberation process\n2. Explicitly acknowledge the tensions between welfare and community rather than attempting to eliminate them\n3. Consider a multi-stage decision process that allows for revisiting earlier conclusions as new information emerges\n4. Document dissenting viewpoints alongside the majority position to preserve ethical complexity\n\nRather than forcing a false consensus, this pluralistic resolution acknowledges that ethical complexity sometimes requires holding multiple valid perspectives in tension. The recommended approach is to continue deliberation with awareness of these different frameworks, while ensuring that decision-making processes remain inclusive of diverse moral viewpoints.\n",
