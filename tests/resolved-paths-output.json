The technology has high accuracy but raises concerns about privacy, potential discrimination, and surveillance creep.), several factors are particularly relevant:\n\nThe following parameters significantly influence how we should balance these competing considerations:\n\n- **Medium potential for life-saving benefits through crime prevention and faster response times** (0.5): This moderate value indicates a balanced approach is needed, weighing both Utilitarianism's and Rights-Based Ethics's perspectives.\n- **The facial recognition system has 85% accuracy in identifying suspects** (0.85): This high value suggests a significant level of the facial recognition system has 85% accuracy in identifying suspects, which strengthens the case for Rights-Based Ethics's concerns about rights.\n- **High impact on privacy as the technology continuously monitors public spaces and collects biometric data** (0.8): This high value suggests a significant level of high impact on privacy as the technology continuously monitors public spaces and collects biometric data, which strengthens the case for Rights-Based Ethics's concerns about rights.\n- **Some alternatives like community policing and improved lighting have been tried with limited success** (0.4): This relatively low value suggests Utilitarianism's emphasis on welfare may deserve greater weight in this context.\n- **The city government holds authority over this decision** (0.5): This moderate value indicates a balanced approach is needed, weighing both Utilitarianism's and Rights-Based Ethics's perspectives.\n- **Direct intervention through technology deployment** (0.5): This moderate value indicates a balanced approach is needed, weighing both Utilitarianism's and Rights-Based Ethics's perspectives.\n- **Limited consent obtained through town halls; no individual opt-out options** (0.2): This relatively low value suggests Utilitarianism's emphasis on welfare may deserve greater weight in this context.\n- **Studies show potential for disparate impact on minority communities** (0.7): This moderate value indicates a balanced approach is needed, weighing both Utilitarianism's and Rights-Based Ethics's perspectives.\n- **Medium transparency about how data will be used and stored** (0.5): This moderate value indicates a balanced approach is needed, weighing both Utilitarianism's and Rights-Based Ethics's perspectives.\n- **The system could be removed, but collected data might persist** (0.4): This relatively low value suggests Utilitarianism's emphasis on welfare may deserve greater weight in this context.\n\n## Balanced Approach\n\nA balanced resolution to this conflict must acknowledge both the welfare raised by Utilitarianism and the rights emphasized by Rights-Based Ethics. Neither framework alone provides a complete solution.\n\nInstead, we should adopt an approach that:\n\n1. Preserves the core welfare of Utilitarianism\n2. Addresses the important rights of Rights-Based Ethics\n3. Adapts the approach based on the specific context and parameters of this dilemma\n\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on the above analysis, a balanced approach would involve:\n\n1. Establish clear boundaries and limitations that respect Rights-Based Ethics's concerns\n2. Implement oversight mechanisms to ensure Utilitarianism's objectives are met responsibly\n3. Create a governance framework with equal representation from both ethical perspectives\n",
