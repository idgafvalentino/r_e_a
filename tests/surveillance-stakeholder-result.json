Prioritize protection of Decision Maker from harm\n2. Implement full_implementation in a way that maximizes benefits (or minimizes harms) to the most affected\n3. Ensure distribution of benefits and burdens is optimized for overall welfare, with special weight given to the most affected\n3. Consider community-wide impacts while still protecting the most vulnerable stakeholders\n\nThis approach balances the welfare considerations from undefined with the community considerations from undefined, while giving appropriate priority to those most affected by the decision.\n",
