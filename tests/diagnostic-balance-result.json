Neither framework alone provides a complete solution.\n\nInstead, we should adopt an approach that:\n\n1. Preserves the core ethical considerations of Utilitarianism\n2. Addresses the important ethical considerations of Kantian Deontology\n3. Adapts the approach based on the specific context and parameters of this dilemma\n\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on the above analysis, a balanced approach would involve:\n\n1. Establish clear boundaries and limitations that respect Kantian Deontology's concerns\n2. Implement oversight mechanisms to ensure Utilitarianism's objectives are met responsibly\n3. Create a governance framework with equal representation from both ethical perspectives\n",
